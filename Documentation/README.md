#README

The PYTO APP offers another IDE and environment for the development of python apps on the IOS platform

Being quite early in its development, the documentation has scope for development and improvement.

This folder holds my investigation of the app and my attempts at providing documentation and guidance for my own development projects

Please help yourself and offer any addtional information you feel might benefit the PYTO community
